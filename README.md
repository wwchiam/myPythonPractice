# myPythonPractice

Welcome to mypythonpractice â€“ a personal repository where I, a data analyst since 2016, explore and practice Python!

ðŸ‘‹ About Me
I'm a data analyst with nearly a decade of experience, primarily working with SAS and SQL to clean & transform data, as well as build data marts to support analytics. My Python exposure has been minimal so far â€” mainly using pre-built scripts for Airflow scheduling.

But it's time to change that.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of This Repo
This repository is my hands-on sandbox for learning Python the right way â€” from the ground up.

Here, youâ€™ll find:

Practice scripts covering Python fundamentals

Notes on best practices and clean code

Small projects and challenges I take on as I learn

Possibly some mistakes â€” learning is messy!

ðŸ“Œ Why I'm Doing This
While Python hasnâ€™t been central to my work, I see its growing importance in data. My goal is to become more confident in:

Writing clean and efficient Python code

Understanding how Python can complement my SQL/SAS work

Automating workflows beyond Airflow templates


ðŸš§ Work in Progress
This is a living project. If you're visiting and have tips or notice something I can improve â€” feel free to open an issue or leave a comment. Feedback is always welcome!
